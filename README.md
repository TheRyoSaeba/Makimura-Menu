# CortanaMatrix
This originally started as simple mafiamatrix script and bot , got started working on a MafiaMatrix modmenu before i got banned. 
 
The .JS is a Userscript you can still using tampermonkey.

 This code is almost certainly what triggered the ban, the submit function repeats on loop an insane amount
