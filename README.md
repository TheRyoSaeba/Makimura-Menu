# CortanaMatrix
This originally started as simple mafiamatrix script and bot , got started working on a MafiaMatrix modmenu before i got banned. 

The .JS is a Userscript you can still using tampermonkey : https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/462039-cortanamatrix
 
 Lot of thanks to : https://github.com/nonumbershere  ; Helped me significantly 
 
 
 This code is almost certainly what triggered the ban, the submit function repeats on loop an insane amount
